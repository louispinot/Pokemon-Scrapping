This is the remainer of an aborted project but I keep it because I find it pretty cool. Forget the childish touch, the original plan was to re-do pokemon with othe LeWagon students but we thought we could do more relevant projects :)

More seriously, what learnable-attacks.rb does is scrap 100+ pages (one per pokemon) to get data from the first table on each page and store it in a CSV file: attack-ref-file.csv

Example of one such page:
